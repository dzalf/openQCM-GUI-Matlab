# openQCM-GUI-Matlab

In order to use this code for data acquisition, open the file *OpenDaqQCM.fig* using GUIDE from Matlab (>= R2017a). 

Run:
    > GUIDE
    
from the Matlab console

Another route is to run the script *OpenDAQCM.m* that will open the GUI interface

UPDATE: Currently working on a massive upgrade
